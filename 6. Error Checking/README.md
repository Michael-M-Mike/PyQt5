# Separation of Concerns

Before jumping into code, we need to introduce the idea of separation of concerns.

As projects get larger, multiple people will have to work on multiple aspects of the projects.

For example, in our CPU Scheduler project, we'd have one person that writes the code for the scheduling algorithms and another that deals with the GUI code.

Each person will work in a separate file and thus some design structure must be adopted in order for the project to work properly.

## Model-View-Controller

MVC is a common software design pattern which divides the software into three components:
- Model
  - It contains the logic and functionality of the project that is **INDEPENDANT** of the user interface.
- View
  - It contains anything that is related to the GUI.
- Controller
  - This is the linker between the two. It makes sure that the model and the view work together properly.

However we don't really need all 3 components, because the code generated by Qt designer is basically the view and the controller combined.
So we'll use a **Model-View** structure, where the project will be divided into 2 files:
- model.py
- view.py

# Titanic Survivors

A very popular dataset used in machine learning is the titanic dataset. It's used to train machine learning algorithms so that they can predict whether a person survived the titanc, given his ticket class, sex, and age.
To see error handling and MV structure in action, we'll create a very simplified version of this. It'll will look like this.

It's simply just a table where the user fills the persons' names, sex, and age and after clicking on "check survivors" pushbutton, the last column in the table will be filled to show whether each person survived or died.

The decision is based on this table:
